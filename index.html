        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img class="self" src="assets/images/selfie.jpg" alt="Jeff's Portrait">
        <p> All kinds of happy little splashes. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It's about to freeze me to death.</p>
        <ul class="aboutMe">
                <li>We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will.</li>
                <li>If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.</li>
                <li>Fluff that up.</li>
                <li>If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. There we go. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.</p>
        <p>In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Anyone can paint. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. You can create anything that makes you happy.</p>
        <p>No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Happy painting, God bless. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Have fun with it.</p>
